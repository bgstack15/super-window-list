# Overview
The Cinnamon built-in window list applet does not provide an option for viewing all windows across all workspaces. This applet adds a toggle switch in the settings, so you can turn on "Show Windows from All Workspaces."

# License
GPLv2, because of the re-use of Cinnamon components which are GPLv2.

# Reference
This applet is a shameless duplicate and modification of window-list@cinnamon.org from package cinnamon-3.4.6-3.fc26.x86_64.
